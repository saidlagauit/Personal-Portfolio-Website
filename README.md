# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work and the services I offer as a web developer. The website is built using ReactJS, React Router, React Share, Bootstrap with SCSS, and React Scroll.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components.
- **React Router**: It provides routing functionality to enable navigation between different pages or sections within the website.
- **React Share**: This library provides social media sharing buttons, allowing visitors to easily share my work or services.
- **Bootstrap with SCSS**: A popular CSS framework that provides pre-built responsive components and styles. SCSS is used for customizing the Bootstrap styles.
- **React Scroll**: This library enables smooth scrolling functionality, enhancing the user experience when navigating through the website.

## Features

- Responsive design: The website is optimized for various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.
- Portfolio showcase: I display my previous projects and highlight the skills and technologies utilized in each project.
- Services offered: I outline the web development services I provide, including website design, development, and maintenance.
- Contact form: Visitors can easily get in touch with me by filling out a contact form, powered by React Hook Form and emailjs-com.
